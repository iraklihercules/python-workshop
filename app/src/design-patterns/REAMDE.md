## Common Design Patterns

- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
- **Factory Method Pattern:** Defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory Pattern:** Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder Pattern:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Prototype Pattern:** Creates new objects by copying an existing object, thus avoiding the need to instantiate new objects.
- **Adapter Pattern:** Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper that converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.
- **Decorator Pattern:** Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- **Observer Pattern:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Strategy Pattern:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, allowing the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
 
- **Command Pattern:** Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **Template Method Pattern:** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
- **State Pattern:** Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, encapsulating state-specific behavior into separate classes and delegating the responsibility for state transitions.
- **Iterator Pattern:** Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
