# The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.
# It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, converting the interface of one class into another interface
# that a client expects. This pattern allows existing classes to be reused without modifying their code.

# MediaPlayer: Represents the target interface that the client expects. It defines a method play() to play audio files.
# AdvancedMediaPlayer: Represents the source interface with advanced features. It defines methods play_mp4() and
# play_vlc() to play MP4 and VLC files, respectively.
# Mp4Player and VlcPlayer: Concrete implementations of the AdvancedMediaPlayer interface for playing MP4 and VLC files.
# MediaAdapter: Acts as an adapter between the MediaPlayer and AdvancedMediaPlayer interfaces. It adapts the play()
# method of MediaPlayer to call the appropriate methods of AdvancedMediaPlayer based on the audio type.
# AudioPlayer: Represents the client that uses the MediaPlayer interface. It plays MP3 files directly and uses the
# MediaAdapter to play MP4 and VLC files.

# In this example, the AudioPlayer class represents the client code that expects to play audio files using the
# MediaPlayer interface. When the AudioPlayer receives requests to play MP4 or VLC files, it delegates the task to the
# MediaAdapter, which acts as an adapter to the AdvancedMediaPlayer interface and plays the files using the appropriate
# methods. This way, the AudioPlayer can work with both MP3 and advanced audio formats without directly depending on
# their implementations.
