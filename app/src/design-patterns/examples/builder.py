# - Pizza: Represents the product to be built. It has attributes for size, crust, and toppings.
# - PizzaBuilder: Represents the builder, which constructs the product step by step. It provides methods to set the
# size, crust, and add toppings to the pizza.
# - set_size(), set_crust(), add_topping(): Methods for setting the attributes of the pizza. Each method returns the
# builder instance to enable method chaining.
# - build(): Method that returns the constructed pizza object.
# - Client code: In the client code, a PizzaBuilder instance is created, and methods are called to set the size,
# crust, and toppings of the pizza. Finally, the build() method is called to get the constructed pizza object.

# The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same
# construction process to create different representations. It promotes code readability and maintainability by
# providing a clear and fluent interface for building objects.
