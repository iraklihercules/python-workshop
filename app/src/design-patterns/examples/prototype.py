# The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an
# existing object, known as a prototype, instead of creating new instances from scratch. This pattern is useful
# when the construction of a new object is more efficient by copying an existing object rather than creating it
# from scratch, especially if the object creation process is complex or resource-intensive.

# Prototype: This class acts as a prototype manager that holds a collection of prototype objects and allows
# clients to register, unregister, and clone these objects.
# register_object(): Method to register a prototype object with a given name.
# unregister_object(): Method to unregister a prototype object by its name.
# clone(): Method to clone a prototype object by its name and optionally update its attributes.
# Car: This class represents a prototype object that the client wants to clone. In this example, Car instances
# represent different car models.
# Client code: In the client code, a Prototype instance is created, and a Car object is registered with the
# prototype manager. Then, the client clones the registered car object, optionally updating its year attribute,
# and prints the cloned car object.

# The Prototype Pattern allows you to create new objects by copying existing objects, providing a flexible and
# efficient way to create objects with the same structure but potentially different states. It is especially
# useful when the construction of new objects is complex or resource-intensive, as it avoids the need to
# recreate the object from scratch.
