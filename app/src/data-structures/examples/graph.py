# _init__: Initializes the graph with an empty adjacency list.
# add_edge(u, v): Adds an edge between nodes u and v to the graph's adjacency list.
# dfs(start_node): Performs a Depth First Search (DFS) traversal starting from the start_node.
# bfs(start_node): Performs a Breadth First Search (BFS) traversal starting from the start_node.

# In this example, the graph is represented using an adjacency list, where each node is a key
# in the dictionary graph, and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent nodes.
# The dfs and bfs methods traverse the graph starting from a given node using Depth First Search and
# Breadth First Search, respectively.
