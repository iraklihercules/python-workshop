- What are common advanced data structures in Python for coding interviews?

In coding interviews, it's common to encounter questions that involve advanced data structures beyond the basic ones like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Here are some advanced data structures in Python that are frequently used in coding interviews:

1. Binary Search Trees (BST):
- Binary trees where each node has at most two children, and the left child is less than the parent, while the right child is greater.
- Useful for searching, insertion, and deletion operations with a time complexity of O(log n) in the average case.

2. Heaps:
- Specialized tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property (either min-heap or max-heap).
- Useful for implementing priority queues and for efficient retrieval of the minimum or maximum element.

3. Graphs:
- A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes.
- Various representations are used, such as adjacency lists or adjacency matrices.
- Common algorithms on graphs include depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and algorithms for finding shortest paths (Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm).

4. Tries (Prefix Trees):
- Tree data structures used for storing a dynamic set of strings where each node represents a common prefix.
- Useful for tasks like autocomplete, spell checking, and dictionary implementations.

5. Segment Trees:
- Tree data structures used for handling intervals or segments of elements, typically for range query and update operations.
- Useful for solving problems related to range queries, such as finding the sum, minimum, maximum, or greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements within a range.

6. Disjoint Set (Union-Find) Data Structure:
- A data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into disjoint subsets.
- Useful for solving problems involving connectivity, such as finding connected components in a graph or implementing Kruskal's algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees.

7. Suffix Trees and Suffix Arrays:
- Data structures used for indexing and searching substrings within a larger string.
- Useful for tasks like pattern matching, substring search, and longest common substring problems.

8. Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees):
- Data structures used to efficiently update and query the prefix sums of an array.
- Useful for solving problems related to cumulative frequency or range sum queries.

9. LRU Cache (Least Recently Used Cache):
- A data structure that maintains a fixed-size cache and evicts the least recently used items when the cache reaches its capacity.
- Useful for implementing caching mechanisms and speeding up access to frequently used data.

Understanding these advanced data structures and their associated algorithms can significantly enhance your
problem-solving skills and improve your performance in coding interviews. It's essential to practice
implementing and applying these data structures to various problem scenarios to become proficient in using them effectively.
