# dijkstra function: Implements Dijkstra's Algorithm.
# graph: The weighted graph represented as an adjacency list with the format {vertex: {neighbor: weight}}.
# start: The starting vertex for finding shortest paths.
# The function initializes a dictionary distances to store the shortest distances from the start
# vertex to all other vertices. Initially, all distances are set to infinity, except the distance
# from the start vertex to itself, which is set to 0.
# It uses a priority queue (implemented with a heap) to store (distance, vertex) pairs, with the
# distance serving as the priority.
# The algorithm iterates through vertices in order of increasing distance from the start vertex.
# For each vertex, it updates the distances to its neighbors if a shorter path is found.
# Finally, it returns the dictionary of shortest distances.
# Example usage: Demonstrates how to use the dijkstra function to find the shortest distances
# from a specified start vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.

# Dijkstra's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest paths from a single source
# vertex to all other
# vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. It has a time complexity of O((V + E) log V),
# where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
