# An example of Prim's Algorithm implemented in Python for constructing a minimum spanning
# tree (MST) for a weighted undirected graph:

# prim function: Implements Prim's Algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a given
# weighted undirected graph.
# graph: The weighted graph represented as an adjacency list with the format {vertex: {neighbor: weight}}.
# start: The starting vertex for constructing the MST.
# The function initializes an empty list mst to store the edges of the MST and a set visited to keep
# track of visited vertices.
# It starts from the start vertex and iteratively adds the minimum-weight edge connecting a visited
# vertex to an unvisited vertex to the MST.
# The function uses a heap (edges) to efficiently select the minimum-weight edge to add to the MST.
# The process continues until all vertices are visited.

# Example usage: Demonstrates how to use the prim function to construct the minimum spanning tree (MST)
# of a given weighted undirected graph.

# Prim's Algorithm has a time complexity of O(E * log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is
# the number of edges.
# It efficiently constructs the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph by greedily selecting edges with
# the minimum weight.
