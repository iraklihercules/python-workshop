# An example of Kruskal's Algorithm implemented in Python for constructing a minimum
# spanning tree (MST) for a weighted undirected graph:

# DisjointSet class: Implements the disjoint-set data structure (also known as a union-find data structure)
# to keep track of disjoint sets of vertices. It supports two main operations: find (to find the root of a set)
# and union (to merge two sets).
# kruskal function: Implements Kruskal's Algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a given
# weighted undirected graph.
# graph: The weighted graph represented as an adjacency list with the format {vertex: {neighbor: weight}}.
# The function initializes an empty list mst to store the edges of the MST and a set vertices to store
# all vertices in the graph.
# It constructs a list edges containing all edges of the graph, sorted by weight.
# It iterates through the sorted edges and greedily adds edges to the MST if they do not form a cycle.
# The disjoint-set data structure is used to efficiently detect cycles and merge disjoint sets of vertices.

# Example usage: Demonstrates how to use the kruskal function to construct the minimum spanning tree (MST)
# of a given weighted undirected graph.

# Kruskal's Algorithm has a time complexity of O(E * log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is
# the number of edges.
# It efficiently constructs the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph by greedily selecting edges with
# the minimum weight
# while ensuring that no cycles are formed.
