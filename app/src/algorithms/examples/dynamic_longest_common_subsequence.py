# An example of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem solved using dynamic programming in Python:

# longest_common_subsequence function: Implements the LCS problem using dynamic programming.
# text1 and text2: The input strings for which the LCS needs to be found.
# The function initializes a 2D array dp to store lengths of LCS. dp[i][j] represents the length of
# LCS between text1[:i] and text2[:j].
# It iterates through each character of both strings and fills the dp array according to the LCS recurrence
# relation.
# After filling the dp array, it reconstructs the LCS string by tracing back the longest common subsequence
# from the dp array.

# Example usage: Demonstrates how to use the longest_common_subsequence function to find the longest common
# subsequence between two strings.

# Dynamic programming is used to efficiently solve the LCS problem by breaking it down into smaller
# subproblems and storing the solutions to avoid redundant calculations. The time complexity of the
# LCS algorithm using dynamic programming is O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings.

                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
